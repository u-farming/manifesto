# DRAFT Manifesto for sustainable urban farming

We are trying to uncover better ways of producing
food by doing it and helping others do it. We value:

- **Growing shared knowledge** over intellectual property
- **Saving what we love** over killing what we hate
- **Ensuring peoples' and planet's health** over fews' financial wealth
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there might be value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left much more.
